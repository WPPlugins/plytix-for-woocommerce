[Getting Started with the Plytix PIM](https://support.plytix.com/article/getting-started-with-the-plytix-pim/)

For those brands who do not use an product management system (PIM/DAM/ERP) we provide the Plytix PIM to easily and quickly sync your product images.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Plytix account to use Plytix for WooCommerce? =

Yes, it is necessary to have a Plytix account. It is free to make an account and it can be done in 1 minute [here](https://analytics.plytix.com/signup). This will give you access to your analytics dashboard, where you can slice and dice the data without taking your eyes off your store.

= Can I combine images from Plytix with my manually uploaded images? =

Yes you can. You are by no means excluded from using your own images in your store. If you don't like the pictures on Plytix for a certain product, please don't hesitate to contact us [here](https://plytix.com/contact-plytix).

= Will I always be able to get access to product images for free? =

Absolutely. Fetching product images will always be free of charge, along with all the basic features in our analytics tool.

= How can I sync my products with the Plytix Product Bank? =
If you are a brand owner, you can easily sync your products to the Plytix Product Bank by using our free PIM tool. See the full guide here: [Syncing products with the Plytix PIM](https://support.plytix.com/article/getting-started-with-the-plytix-pim-less-than-25-products/)
For retailers, you must get your brands or manufacturers to upload the product images. In order to maintain the integrity of the bank, retailers are not currently capable of syncing product images to the bank.
